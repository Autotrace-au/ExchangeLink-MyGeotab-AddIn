# FleetBridge - How to Book Equipment

This guide explains how to book vehicles, trailers, and other equipment through Microsoft Outlook or Teams once the equipment mailboxes have been created.

---

## Overview

Each piece of equipment (vehicle, trailer, etc.) has its own email address and calendar. To book equipment, you simply invite the equipment's email address to a meeting, just like you would invite a colleague.

**Equipment Email Format:** `[serial-number]@[your-domain].com.au`

For example:
- `abc123@autotrace.com.au` (vehicle with serial ABC123)
- `trailer456@autotrace.com.au` (trailer with serial TRAILER456)

## Method 1: Booking via Outlook (Desktop or Web)

### Step 1: Create a New Meeting

1. Open **Outlook**
2. Click **New Meeting** (or **New Event** in Outlook Web)
3. Fill in the meeting details:
   - **Title**: What you're using the equipment for (e.g., "Site Visit - Brisbane")
   - **Start time**: When you need the equipment
   - **End time**: When you'll return the equipment
   - **Location** (optional): Where you're taking the equipment

### Step 2: Invite the Equipment

1. In the **Required** attendees field, type the equipment's email address
   - Example: `abc123@autotrace.com.au`
   - Or search for the equipment by name (e.g., "Toyota Hilux ABC123")

2. The equipment will appear in the attendee list

### Step 3: Check Availability

1. Click the **Scheduling Assistant** tab (or **Scheduling** button)
2. You'll see the equipment's calendar showing:
   - **Free** = Available to book
   - **Busy** = Already booked
   - **Out of Office** = Not available

3. Adjust your meeting time if needed to find a free slot

### Step 4: Send the Booking

1. Click **Send**
2. You'll receive one of two responses:

   **✅ Auto-Accepted (No Approval Required)**
   - You'll receive an email: "Accepted: [Your Booking]"
   - The email will contain a prominent confirmation message
   - The equipment is now booked for you
   - It will appear in your calendar with "Accepted" status

   **⏳ Pending Approval (Approval Required)**
   - You'll receive an email: "Tentative: [Your Booking]"
   - A fleet manager or approver needs to approve your request
   - You'll get another email once approved or declined

   **❌ Declined (Not Available)**
   - You'll receive an email: "Declined: [Your Booking]"
   - **IMPORTANT:** The booking will stay in your calendar but you do NOT have the equipment
   - **You MUST delete the calendar entry manually** to avoid confusion
   - Book a different time or different equipment

## Method 2: Booking via Microsoft Teams

### Step 1: Open Teams Calendar

1. Open **Microsoft Teams**
2. Click **Calendar** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New meeting** (top right)

### Step 2: Fill in Meeting Details

## Understanding Response Emails

All booking response emails include this important message:

```
IMPORTANT: Check the meeting status in your calendar:
- ACCEPTED = Equipment is reserved for you
- DECLINED = Equipment is NOT available - DELETE this calendar entry immediately
- TENTATIVE = Awaiting approval from fleet manager

Always cancel bookings you no longer need so others can use the equipment.
```

### Why the Same Message for All Responses?

This is an **Exchange Online limitation** - the system cannot send different messages for accepted vs declined vs tentative bookings. The message reminds you to **check the status** in your calendar to know whether you have the equipment or not.

### What Each Status Means:

| Status | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| ✅ **ACCEPTED** | Equipment is reserved for you | Use the equipment as planned |
| ❌ **DECLINED** | Equipment is NOT available | **DELETE the calendar entry immediately** and book a different time/equipment |
| ⏳ **TENTATIVE** | Awaiting approval from fleet manager | Wait for approval - don't assume you have it yet |

### Critical Warning About Declined Bookings

⚠️ **DECLINED BOOKINGS STAY IN YOUR CALENDAR** ⚠️

When a booking is declined, Exchange does NOT automatically remove it from your calendar. This is standard Exchange behaviour and cannot be changed.

**You MUST manually delete declined bookings** to avoid confusion. If you don't delete them:
- ❌ You might think you still have the equipment
- ❌ You might show up expecting equipment that isn't available
- ❌ Your calendar will show incorrect bookings

**How to delete a declined booking:**
1. Open the declined meeting in your calendar
2. Click **Delete** (or press Delete key)
3. Confirm deletion

  2. Click **Recurrence** (Outlook) or **Repeat** (Teams)
  3. Set your pattern (daily, weekly, monthly)
  4. Send the booking

### Double Booking
- Most equipment **does not allow double booking** (conflicts)

## Approval Process

### Auto-Accept (No Approval)
If the equipment has **no approvers** configured:

### Manual Approval Required
If the equipment has **approvers** configured:
1. Your booking request is sent to the approvers
2. You'll receive a "Tentative" response
3. An approver will review and either:
   - **Accept** your booking → You get the equipment
   - **Decline** your booking → You'll need to book different equipment or time
4. You'll receive an email with the decision

**Approvers** are typically fleet managers or supervisors.

## Tips and Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- **Book in advance** to ensure availability
- **Cancel bookings** you no longer need
- **Use clear titles** so others know what the equipment is being used for
  - Good: "Site Visit - Brisbane CBD"
  - Bad: "Meeting"
- **Check availability** before booking to avoid conflicts
- **Book the right duration** - don't book for longer than you need

### ❌ Don't:
- **Don't book equipment "just in case"** - only book when you're sure you need it
- **Don't leave old bookings** - cancel them if plans change
- **Don't book beyond the maximum duration** - it will be rejected
- **Don't try to double-book** - it won't work (unless specifically allowed)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Your meeting conflicts with another appointment"
**Problem:** The equipment is already booked for that time.

**Solution:**
- Choose a different time slot
- Book different equipment
- Contact the person who has the current booking to see if they can change it

---

### "The booking was declined"
**Problem:** An approver rejected your booking request, or the equipment is not available.

**Solution:**
- **IMPORTANT: DELETE the calendar entry immediately** - Declined bookings stay in your calendar but you do NOT have the equipment
- Contact the approver to understand why it was declined
- Try booking a different time or equipment
- Provide more details in your booking request

**⚠️ WARNING:** Outlook and Teams do NOT automatically remove declined bookings from your calendar. You must manually delete them to avoid confusion.

---

### "You cannot book this far in advance"
**Problem:** You're trying to book beyond the booking window (e.g., more than 90 days ahead).

**Solution:**
- Book closer to the date you need the equipment
- Contact your fleet manager if you need to book further ahead

---

### "The booking exceeds the maximum duration"
**Problem:** Your booking is longer than the maximum allowed (e.g., more than 24 hours).

**Solution:**
- Split your booking into multiple consecutive bookings
- Contact your fleet manager for extended use approval

---

### "I can't find the equipment in the address book"
**Problem:** The equipment mailbox might not be visible in the Global Address List.

**Solution:**
- Type the equipment's email address directly (e.g., `abc123@autotrace.com.au`)
- Contact your IT administrator to make the equipment visible in the address book
